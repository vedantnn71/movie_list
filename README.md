### Prerequisites
I'm assuming that you've **docker**, **pnpm** and **node** already installed on your system.

### Running the project in your environment

Just configure the `.env` and `.env.test` and then run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies that project requires and then:
- run `pnpm start:dev` to start the project's _client_ and _server_ in development mode.
- OR run `pnpm start:prod` to start the project's _client_ and _server_ in production mode.
